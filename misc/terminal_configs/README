I've come across a few terminals in my day...

GNOME-TERMINAL
  The files here are configuration dumps for gnome-terminal.

  Apparently, gnome-terminal can use more than one backend for settings
  management. For example, Arch Linux uses dconf and Ubuntu uses gconf. To ensure
  that I have a working config on whichever backend my gnome-terminal is using,
  I've included these files.

  Below, I list schema path and load command for each backend. schema path is the
  schema to which the dump will be applied. You should check if yours matches
  (e.g. with dconf-editor or gconf-editor). load command is the command you should
  use to apply the configuration dumps.

    DCONF 
      schema path:  /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/
      load command: cat dconf_dump | dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/

    GCONF
      schema path: /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/
      load command: gconftool-2 --load gconf_dump

TERMINAL.APP
  Import hybrid.terminal from Settings->(Gear button)->Import

ITERM2
  Place com.googlecode.iterm2.plist in ~/Library/Preferences/. This seems like
  a binary file, so it could very well become obsolete through version
  updates.
